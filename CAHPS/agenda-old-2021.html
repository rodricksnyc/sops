              <p>
                Interest in using patient narratives to improve care experiences
                has grown rapidly in recent years. Health care organizations and
                online rating sites now routinely post patient comments along
                with survey scores and other quality measures. Recognizing that
                narratives can complement the information obtained through
                standardized Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and
                Systems (CAHPS®) surveys, CAHPS researchers have been developing
                and testing new approaches to collecting and using patient
                narratives. This research has led to the development of several
                CAHPS supplemental Narrative Item Sets. Early testing of these
                questions has revealed important insights on the use of patient
                narratives for identifying and addressing critical needs for
                improving care experiences including emerging issues related to
                equity, empathy, and patient safety.
